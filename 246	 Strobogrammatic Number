A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

For example, the numbers “69”, “88”, and “818” are all strobogrammatic.

using System;

public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		Console.WriteLine(IsStrobogrammatic("818"));
	}
	public static bool IsStrobogrammatic(string num)
	{
		Dictionary<char,char> d = new Dictionary<char,char>(){{'0','0'},{'1','1'},{'8','8'},{'6','9'},{'9','6'},};
		int i = 0,j = num.Length-1;
		while(i<=j){
			if(!d.ContainsKey(num[i])||!d.ContainsKey(num[j])||num[j--]!=d[num[i++]])return false;
		}		
		return true;	
	}
}
